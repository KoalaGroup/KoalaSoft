** Elastic scattering events
*** KoaPPElasticIdealGenerator
**** It generates a uniformly distributed, proton-proton elastic scattering events.
**** The alpha and theta range can be specified    
**** The particles generated can be specified as Geantino instead of proton, which keeps the kinematic features of p-p elastic scattering
